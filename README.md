# README.md
This repository contains most of the work done completing the [Launch School](https://www.launchschool.com) core curriculum. The subdirectories for each of the courses are prepended with the course number. Within each of these there are additional subdirectories for each of the lessons as well as other mini-projects.

The `exercises` subdirectory contains all of the work done completing the various [exercises](https://launchschool.com/exercises) provided by Launch School with the exception of the `Ruby Basics` and `180 - SQL Fundamentals` exercises. Furthermore, it also contains my answers to the exercises found in Launch School's [Introduction to Regular Expressions](https://launchschool.com/books/regex) e-book. The files are organized first by which group of exercises they belong to, and then by their set (e.g., the first set of easy problems for the 101-109 small problems is found in `101-109_small_problems/easy_01`).

Some projects, such as the todo app in courses [130](https://github.com/ncalibey/todolist_project) and [180](https://github.com/ncalibey/180_todos_app), as well the [exercises](https://github.com/ncalibey/LaunchSchool_ITP_Exercises) found in the [Introduction to Programming with Ruby](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby) e-book are not included in this repo and can be found via my [main github page](https://github.com/ncalibey).
