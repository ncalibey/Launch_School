# easy_209.rb - String Assignment
=begin
The program should output:
=> BOB
=> BOB

This is because both name and save_name are set to 'Bob', and so when we call
the destructive method upcase! on name, chaning the value to 'BOB', both
variables will have the same value since they still point towards the same
object.
