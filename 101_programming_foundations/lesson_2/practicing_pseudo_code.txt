ask for first integer
  verify that it is a valid integer
  set it to a variable
repeat the same for second integer
convert both integers into integers (from string) and add them together
  save answer into a new variable
return answer

formal

START

prompts user for first integer
  GETS first integer
  SET variable1 to input

prompts user for second integer
  GETS second integer
  SET variable2 to input

SET answer-variable to sum of variable1 and variable2

PRINT answer-variable

casual

ask for array of strings
  create a new empty variable
  iterate over the array, adding each element into the empty variable
  return the variable to the user

formal

START

# Given an array of strings called "strings"

SET final result variable (x) to an empty string

iterate over the array
  for each iteration, SET 'x' to 'x' + element

PRINT 'x'

***

given an array of integers:
  iterate over the array but only take every other value
  put every other value into a new array
  print the new array to the user

# Given an array of integers called 'numbers'

SET iterator = 1
SET new_array = a blank array which will store the numbers

UNTIL iterator > length of the array
  iterate over the array
  IF iterator is odd
    store the value in new_array
  ELSE
    skip to the next iteration

  iterator += 1

PRINT new_array to user
