  The goal of Twenty-One is to get a hand whose value is as close to 21 as possible
  without going over (if you do, you 'bust'). Numbered cards are worth the amount
  they display, while face cards (King, Queen, and Jack) are worth 10 points each.
  Aces are worth either 1 or 11 points depending upon which favors you better.

  => During your turn you may either 'hit', which means draw another card, or 'stay',
  which means you are done adding to your hand. Next the dealer goes and does the
  same process. Afterwards the totals are added up and compared, and whoever was
  closer to 21 wins.

  => You may enter 'help' during your turn to come back to this screen.
